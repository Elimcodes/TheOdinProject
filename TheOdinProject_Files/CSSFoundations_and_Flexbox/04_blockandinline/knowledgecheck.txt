1. The difference between a block element and an inline element is:
block elements appear on the page stacked atop eachother, each new element starting on a new line,
 while an inline element continues in the pre-existing line (not starting on a new one).
 Inline elements appear in line with whatever elements they are placed beside. 

 2. The difference between an inline element and an inline-block element is that:
 inline-block elements are allowed to set a width and height on the element, while 
 with an inline element top and bottom margins and paddings are not respected (but 
 with inline-block elements they are).

 3. An h1 element is a block.
 4. A button element is inline. 
 5. A div element is block.
