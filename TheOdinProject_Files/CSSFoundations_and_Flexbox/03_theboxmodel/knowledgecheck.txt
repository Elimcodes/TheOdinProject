From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?
What does the box-sizing CSS property do?
What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?
Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?
Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?
Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap each other?

1. content, padding, border, and margin. 
2. The box-sizing css property sets how the total width and height of 
an element is calculated. 
3. If you are using the standard box model, 
the size of the border is added to the width and height of the content
box. 
When you are using the alternative box model, the size of the border
makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of that available
width and height of the element box. 

The difference between the two is that the standard box Models
border is added to the width and height of the content box, 
while the alternative box model's border makes the content box
smaller as it takes up some of the available width and height of the 
element box. 

4.I would use margin to create space between 2 elements. 

5. I would use padding to create more space between the contents
of an element and its border. 

6. I would use negative margins, if I wanted two elements to overlap
each other.
