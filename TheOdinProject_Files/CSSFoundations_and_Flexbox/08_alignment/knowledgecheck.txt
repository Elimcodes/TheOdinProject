How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?
Whatâ€™s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?

1. justify-content changes the orientation of the item along the main axis, 
while align-items changes the orientation of the item along the cross axis. 

2. You can use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container by 
typing:

selector {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center; 
    justify-content: center; 
}

3. The difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around 
is that with space between, there is space between the left, middle and right items, but not around them.
With space-around there is space between the left, middle, and right items and around them.
