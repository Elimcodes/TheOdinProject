How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?
In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
Why do the previous two questions have different answers?

1. You can make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally by
using the 

.flex-container {
    flex-direction: column; 
} 
property.

2. In a column flex-container, flex-basis refers to height, instead of width. 

3. In a row flex container, flex-basis refers to width, instead of height. 

4. The previous two questions have different answers because they have different
main axis and cross axis. 

With flex-direction: row, the main axis is left to right, and the cross axis is top to bottom.
With flex-direction: column, the main axis is top to bottom, and the cross axis is left to right.
