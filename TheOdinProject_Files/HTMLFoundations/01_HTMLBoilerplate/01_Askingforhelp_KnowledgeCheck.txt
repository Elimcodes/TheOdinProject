Asking for help:
Name at least one thing your question should always include.
Describe the “XY Problem”.
Describe three attributes of a “help vampire”.
1. Your question should always include your code
and the surrounding context.
2. The user wants to do x.
The user doesnt know how to to x, but thinks
they can fumble their way to a solution
if they can just manage to do y.
User doesnt know how to do Y either
User asks for help with Y.
Others try to help user with Y 
but are confused because Y seems like
a strange problem to want to solve. 
After interaction and wasted time, it
becomes clear that the user really wants
help with X, and that y wasn't a suitable
solution to x. 
Basically: the problem occurs when people
get stuck on what they believe is the solution
and are unable to step back and explain the issue
in full.
