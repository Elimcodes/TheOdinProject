What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?
What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?
How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?
Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?
What does the descendant combinator do?
Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?

1. external css is when the html document links an external (.css) document for 
markup information. The linking is done inside an HTML's opening and closing
<head> tags with a self closing <link> element. 
Internal css is when the styling information is written within the HTML document, 
as opposed to being in a completely seperate file. 
In line css is when the styling information is written in an inline attribute, written 
directly inside the HTML elements tag. 
ex) <h1 style=""/> 

2. Class selectors will select all elements within the given class,
which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. 
ID selectors select an element with the given ID, which is another attribute you
place on an HTML element. 

3. You can apply a single rule to two different selectors by adding a comma between
them. 

4. I would chain the id of title and the class of primary, by placing them side 
by side. 

5. The desendant combinator causes elements that match the last
selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc) 
that matches the previous selector.

6. A class selector will always beat any number of type selectors. 
The rule that uses one class selector has higher specificity than the rule
that uses three type selectors.
